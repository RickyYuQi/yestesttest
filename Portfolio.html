			<h2>Anime</h2>
			<p> Anime has always been a staple for my main source of entertainment which started when I was young. My first anime started with Dragon Ball Z when I was just 6
                            and since then, I began watching more and more anime. In addition to nostalgia, I enjoy and appreciate the art style and storytelling it gives, keeping me constantly engaged.
                            My favourite anime consits of Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, Slam Dunk and more. Recently, I began to read more manga than anime as it usually takes too long for a new season of an anime
                            to come out as well as finding mangas that are more under the radar with amazing stories. Anime has been there for nearly my whole life and has really helped me through many hard-ships.

			<h2>Basketball</h2>
			<p> The sport I always adored was Basketball, I grew up in a household where my older brother and Dad loved and played it vigorously.
		            My Dad is a huge NBA fan and played a lot in in his younger years as well as playing here and then when older, my older brother is also passionate and is addicted
                            to NBA and still plays nearly daily. I followed them in their passion for Basketball and have played since. In the Phillipines, Basketball is a main sport
                            and almost everyone plays or knows about it, they would hold many big practice sessions in our school and I would always participate and have an amazing time playing
                            and learning Basketball. When I moved to Australia, I still held onto it, playing everyday after school and would join teams to play games. I stopped playing for teams in year 11 as
                            I needed to put more focus on VCE and found another hobby of working out to accompany it. I had to make more time to going to the gym and my basketball team wasn't winning as often, so I made the choice to leave the team.
                            I still follow NBA and always look back to the days I played with my friends in the afternoon and having tons of fun, this hobby has done so much for me.
                            My favourite player is Derrick Rose as I love his playstyle and how explosive he can be when he drives for a dunk or lay-up. He is extremely fast and good at mid-air situations which led to me
                            idolizing him.

			<h2>Gym</h2>
			<p> I have always been a hands on and physical person and after wanting to find a new hobby, I came accross gym. One of my friends was a huge influence to why I wanted to gym
                            and he was willing to help me start off and be there to spot me and develop me to what I aimed to be. I mostly wanted to hit the gym for basketball but it was more for myself and being able to 
                            calm down and relax my mind from stress. It ended up becoming a weekly routine to work out and has really helped me understand how my body functions and how muscles function. Due to Covid, I have not been
                            going as frequently and have lost some motivation to go. However, in 2021 I aim to re-ignite it and start to go for myself as I want to be the best part of myself without any regrets.

		<div class="Gaming">
			<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<p> The most important thing to me is probably gaming. I grew up playing tons of games on the PS2, PSP and DS and when I got the PS3 I played it almost non-stop and was addicted to it. I started with Call of Duty
                            and played other games like Spider-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more. As I grew older, I played even more games on the PS4 and recently got a new Gaming PC. One of dream was to always get a gaming PC and after year 12,
                            I was able to save up enough to buy one. I wanted a PC for gaming but also for following my next dream, to be a youtuber or streamer, playing games I enjoy and entertaining others in the process. 
                            I've played various games and I have many favourites but my favourites of all time would consist of Yakuza series, Borderlands series, Tekken series, Left 4 dead series, Marvel vs capcom series and more.

			<h2>IT Experience</h2>
			<p> I have always been around technology since I was born into this progressive era of technology and I've seen all of the new innovations and creations people have made.
                            I studied IT in high school and was always intrested in how programs like html, Access and java worked. The earliest signs of intrest for IT would be in primary school as we were
                            given tasks to program a robot car with movement commands like forward, back, turn and more. I found that really intresting and resulted in me following IT to highschool and that's when
                            I really thought about having it as my career. My parents believed it was the right career choice and now I'm planning to extend my knowledge even more.

		<div class="MEET">
			<h2>Meeting people</h2>
			<p> One of the most exciting parts of life in my personal opinion is meeting new people. There are so many different people with unique experiences
                            and I love hearing them. A main part of humanity is being friendly and open to each other, and I believe that meeting new people and bonding with them is
                            what makes us human.
